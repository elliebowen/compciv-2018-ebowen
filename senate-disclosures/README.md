# Final project summary 

My idea for a report on Senate finance disclosures is to look at how many Senators directly benefited, in a personal wealth capacity, from the 2017 Tax Bill, based on whether or not they meet the criteria for the tax cut that applies to top earners (i.e they earn over $470,700). A visualization idea is to represent the monetary profits that each upper bracket Senator has made as a result of the Tax Bill.
