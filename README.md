This repository is a compilation of computational journalism assignments that I completed for a Stanford class called Computational Methods in the Civic Sphere. In this course we learned how to use web scraping via Python to organize and uncover data for investigative news stories and data projects. Some of these projects include using publically available data to track the number of inmates on Death Row and to assess their charges and to track the personal monetary gain of certain politicians in regards to tax policy.
